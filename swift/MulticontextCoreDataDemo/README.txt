Thid project is my attempt to implement multicontext core data structure described in http://www.cocoanetics.com/2012/07/multi-context-coredata/.
The cintinuation and discussion of some possible issues with that approach can be found in http://www.cocoanetics.com/2013/02/zarra-on-locking/.

To my mind and in spite of the fact that these articles are rather old I can learn a lot from them and make myself more comfortable in working with Core Data.

It is interesting that there is a couple of newer articles on the COMGF from same author about Core Data, maybe they can give us more modern approach or at least swifty code.)
